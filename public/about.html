    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Clove and I am a Web Developer in Houston, TX. I aspire
      to create a successful language learning website that teaches practical
      language learning rather than what is the same curriculum, but on a
      different website. I am an avid chess player and have played in multiple
      USCF-rated tournaments.

      I took up web development as a challenge to myself. I love learning
      languages and coding languages are just other languages after all. I
      absolutely love reading Romance novels and Fantasy novels in my spare
      time. I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and I love watching shows and movies
      about the Supernatural.
    </p>

      Another part I absolutely love about learning languages is the opportunity
      to learn about what other people value and the various traditions of other
      cultures. As someone who loves learning about World History it's an
      amazing opportunity to learn about another country's history. The World is
      an amazing place and that is one of the things I am excited to show others
      when I make my website.

    <h1>The Absolute Best Movies Ever</h1>
    <h2>Just Kidding, Just my Opinion</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith</h3>
    <p>
      The Star Wars films were some of the first movies I ever watched growing
      up and it would be incredibly foolish for me to not include this title in
      my top rankings. Space fantasies are also just superior, sorry not sorry.
    </p>
    <h3>The Twilight Saga: Eclipse</h3>
    <p>
      The Twilight Saga is fantastically bad, and it is entirely because of that
      that any of the movies are making their way onto this list. I'm also just
      a huge fan of vampires, so I can't help that I love it.
    </p>
    <h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
    <p>
      This movie is an absolutely amazing animated film about the impacts of
      bullying and the importance of found family, and I think it does an
      amazing job of shedding light on how often those with disabilities are
      bullied.
